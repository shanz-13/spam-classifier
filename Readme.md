# SMS/Mail spam classifier

A message spam classifier project built using ensemble learning models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages and uses features extracted through NLP techniques.

Technologies Used
- Libraries:
    - Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model
    - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
    - NLTK: For natural language processing tasks
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
    - Streamlit: For building an interactive web application
- Model: Voting Classifier Ensemble Model with Extra Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier as base models
